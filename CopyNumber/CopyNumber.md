Copy number variation (CNV)
```bash
wget https://gdc.xenahubs.net/download/GDC-PANCAN.masked_cnv.tsv.gz
gzip -d GDC-PANCAN.masked_cnv.tsv.gz
```
Raw data was generated by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array.
The CNV files are genomic regions and log2(copy-number /2). Diploid regions will have a segment mean of zero, amplified regions will have positive values, and deletions will have negative values.
Copy Number Estimation
-   Genes with focal CNV values smaller than -0.3 are categorized as a "loss" (-1)
-   Genes with focal CNV values larger than 0.3 are categorized as a "gain" (+1)
-   Genes with focal CNV values between and including -0.3 and 0.3 are categorized as "neutral" (0).
