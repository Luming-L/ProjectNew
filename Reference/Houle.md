# Association between PRDM9 expression and recurrently mutated regions
Somatic mutations may affect PRDM9 expression. The mutations in which gene may affect the expression of PRDM9.
## input
PRDM9 expression level
Reccuently mutated regions: at least 2 SNVs were located with 100bp from each other across all tumor samples.
## process
linear regression
## output
# PRDM9 binding motif analysis
# Odds rations calculations
