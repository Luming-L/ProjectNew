# Association between PRDM9 expression and recurrently mutated regions
Somatic mutations may affect PRDM9 expression. The mutations in which gene may affect the expression of PRDM9. We need regions where SNVs cluster across all samples, because they are comparable.
## input
PRDM9 expression level
Reccuently mutated regions: at least 2 SNVs were located with 100bp from each other across all tumor samples.
## process
linear regression
## output
# PRDM9 binding motif analysis
# Odds rations calculations
