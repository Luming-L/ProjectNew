# Refine recalled peaks 
Refine recalled peaks to get a list of peaks for each biological sample
## input files
**Cancer type-specific peak calls (23)**
Each text file represents all merged peak calls from each cancer type. 
**Recalled peaks in each technical replicate (796)**

```
`-f`ï¼š Minimum overlap required as **a fraction of A**. `-f 1.0` means 100% of the query record is overlapped by a database record.
`-c`: For each entry in A, report the number of hits in B while restricting to -f.
`-wa`: Write the original entry in A for each overlap.
