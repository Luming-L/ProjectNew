# Refine recalled peaks 
Refine recalled peaks to get a list of peaks for each biological sample
## input files
**Cancer type-specific peak calls (23)**
Each text file represents all merged peak calls from each cancer type. 
**Recalled peaks in each technical replicate (796)**
The output of PeakRecall.py, see PeakRecall.md
## steps
### download cancer type-specific PeakCalls
```bash
wget https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/71ccfc55-b428-4a04-bb5a-227f7f3bf91c
unzip 71ccfc55-b428-4a04-bb5a-227f7f3bf91c
mkdir TCGA-ATAC_Cancer_Type-specific_PeakCalls
mv *.txt TCGA-ATAC_Cancer_Type-specific_PeakCalls
```
### prepare the input of bedtools
sort files
```bash
# sort and cut files of Cancer Type-specific PeakCalls
cd /exports/eddie/scratch/s1949868/TCGA-ATAC_Cancer_Type-specific_PeakCalls
for file in $(ls); do sort -k1,1 -k2,2n $file | awk '{FS=OFS="\t"; if($1~/^chr/){print $1,$2,$3,$4;}}' > /exports/eddie/scratch/s1949868/Sample_PeakCalls/${file}.sorted; done
# cut files of recalled peaks in each technical replicate
cd /exports/eddie/scratch/s1949868/PeakRecall_peaks001
for file in $(ls); do sort -k1,1 -k2,2n $file | awk '{FS=OFS="\t"; if($1~/^chr/){print $1,$2,$3}}' > /exports/eddie/scratch/s1949868/Sample_PeakCalls/${file}.sorted; done
```
### Refine recalled peaks by using `bedtools intersect`
1. for each technical replicate (796), output cancer type-specific peaks that can be 100% overlapped by recalled peaks (set by `-f 1.0`)
2. refined peaks in two replicates from the same sample will be merged. only report peaks obeserved in two replicates (set by `-c`)
3. finally get a list of peaks for each of 410 biological samples

`-f`ï¼š Minimum overlap required as **a fraction of A**. `-f 1.0` means 100% of the query record is overlapped by a database record.
`-c`: For each entry in A, report the number of hits in B while restricting to -f.
`-wa`: Write the original entry in A for each overlap.
```bash
bedtools intersect -a /home/s1949868/test_Overlap/Sample_PeakCalls_w/ACC*txt.sorted -b /home/s1949868/test_Overlap/Sample_PeakCalls_w/ACCx_025FE5F8_885E_433D_9018_7AE322A92285_X034_S09*bed.sorted -f 1.0 -c -wa | awk '{FS=OFS="\t";if($5>1){print $1,$2,$3,$4}}' > /home/s1949868/test_Overlap/Sample_PeakCalls_w/ACCx_025FE5F8_885E_433D_9018_7AE322A92285_X034_S09_peakCalls.bed
