	Refine recalled peaks from 796 technical replicates by using `bedtools intersect`:
	1.for each technical replicate, output cancer type-specific peaks that can be 100% overlapped by recalled peaks
	2.refined peaks in two replicates from the same sample will be merged. only report peaks obeserved in two replicates
	3.finally get a list of peaks for each of 410 biological samples

		sample: ID for replicates from the same biological sample
		path: the path of input files (sorted Cancer type-specific peakCalls and all samples recalled peaks) and output files
