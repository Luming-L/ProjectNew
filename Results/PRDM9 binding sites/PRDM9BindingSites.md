meiotic recombination protein 
a specific marker of meiotic DSBs

direct PRDM9 binding in the human genome
ChIP-seq in HEK293T cells transfected with the human PRDM9 reference allele (the ‘B’ allele) containing an N-terminal YFP tag that was targeted for immunoprecipitation.
170,198 PRDM9 binding peaks across the genome (p<10−6)
